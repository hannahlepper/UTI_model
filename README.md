## Modelling Antibiotic Resistance in Urinary Tract Infections in the UK

This repo a brief modelling project to see whether current models can capture observed changes in trimethoprim resistance in urinary cultures in the UK. The model looks at transmission and within-host dynamics of uropathogenic _E. coli_ in the gut microbiome.

Please open the model.ipynb to see the model and a description. It will take a minute or so to load.
